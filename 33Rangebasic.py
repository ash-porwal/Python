# Range function in python is use to generate a sequence of a number
# for a in range(3, 10):
#     print(a)

# We can also specify the start stop stepsize
# for b in range(3, 10, 2): #(Start, end, step)
#     print(b)

#if the range start and end are same then it wont print anything
for x in range(2,2):
    print(x)
