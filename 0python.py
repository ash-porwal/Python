Python was released by Guido van Rossum in 1991

- Python is Interpreted Language -
  That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.

- Python is Dynamically typed Language - means the type of our variables are going to be checked at run time and not at the compiled time.
    dynamically typed, this means that you don't need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. 

- In Python, functions are first-class objects. 
  This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects

- Python is a high level language - When we say "Python is a high-level language," 
    we're referring to the level of abstraction between the language and the computer's hardware. 
    Means - Python's syntax is closer to human language, making it easier to read and write. We don't need to write code in that language which machine understands.
    So, python code gets converted into machine code but we dont do it from our side, it is automatic.
    In Low level language we would be writing code in that syntax which machine would understand. like: 0110000111000


- PEP 8 - stands for Python Enhancement Proposal
  is the style guide for writing Python code. PEP 8 itself is just a document that describes the conventions for writing readable Python code.

- There are tools that have been created to check your code against the PEP 8 guidelines, 
  and these tools can issue warnings if your code doesn't adhere to the conventions.
  One popular tool is flake8. 
  When you run flake8 on your Python code, it checks for violations of PEP 8 guidelines and other potential programming issues, then warns you about them.

  Just in case if want to use flake8
  pip install flake8
  flake8 your_python_file.py

- Difference between scriptig and programming language?
  Scripting means - to automate the certain tasks, scripting languages don't require compilation steps and they are interpreted.
  Example: Java code needs to be compiled before running.
  Where - Python, PHP, JS - needs no compilation

  So, Programming languages are compiled whereas scripting languages are interpreted.
  But Python can also compile its code into bite code and then interpret it.
