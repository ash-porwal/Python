# The string is a data type in Python.

# A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

# We can primarily write a string in three ways:

# Single quoted strings : a = 'qwerty'
# Double quoted strings : b = "qwerty"
# Triple quoted strings : c = '''qwerty'''
# so why needed three ways to put strings..
# cuz if we write something in apostrophy then we use double quote so the compiler wont get confused
# like this =
# a = "Ashish's"
# and if we are using double and sigle quote then we then can ise triple  quotes...alos if we want to print multiline then also  we should put in triple quote
# a = '''ashish's and ashish"s '''

# if we want length of string..we can use len function
# this is how we concatenate two
greet = 'good morning, '
name = 'Ashish'
print(greet + name) # if we add two strings then it may complete one sentnece
# we can also do this
c = greet + name
print(c)

#strings are immutable
